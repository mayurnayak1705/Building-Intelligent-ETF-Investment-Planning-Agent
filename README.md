# Building-Intelligent-ETF-Investment-Planning-Agent
Excited to share my latest AI project that integrates multiple specialized agents to design customized ETF portfolios tailored to individual investment goals. This system employs intelligent collaboration among agents to recommend optimal portfolios based on capital, risk tolerance, investment strategy, and time horizon.

How It Works:
1.ETF Data Collection Agent: Gathers ETF data from sources like NSE India, filtering them based on user-defined criteria.
2.ETF Analysis Agent: Analyzes and ranks ETFs based on factors like historical performance, sector exposure, and expense ratios.
3.Portfolio Planning Agent: Constructs a diversified portfolio, balancing stability (gold ETFs) and growth potential (equity ETFs).
4.Portfolio Validation Agent: Reviews and validates the portfolio to ensure alignment with user goals.

ðŸ”§ Core Tools:
Leveraged web search and scraping tools for real-time data collection.
Modular tasks for data analysis, portfolio creation, and validation, ensuring robust and actionable results.

Sample Output:
 For a â‚¹100,000 investment with a focus on low risk over a 5-year mid-term horizon, the system recommended:
60% Gold ETFs for stability and inflation hedging.
40% Equity ETFs for diversified exposure to the Nifty 50 Index.

Why This Matters:
The project demonstrates how AI and LLM-based agents can revolutionize financial planning by delivering customized, data-driven recommendations while reducing human effort. Itâ€™s a step towards making financial markets more accessible to individual investors!
